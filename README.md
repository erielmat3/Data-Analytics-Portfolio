# Data Analytics Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate my skills in data analysis, such as **descriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, predictive analytics, and prescriptive analytics**. I will also upload every upcoming data science related projects in this repository.

## About Me
Hi! My name is Eriel, and I am an Industrial Engineering graduate with a passion in Data Analytics. I have a keen interest in turning data into meaningful insights to support decision making and drive business improvements.

As an industrial engineering graduate, I bring a strong foundation in optimization and problem-solving skills to the field of data analytics. I am able to not only analyze data, but also understand business and operational context behind it. With my experience, I believe I can translate complex data into actionable insights that can improve efficiency and support strategic decision-making.

I am skilled in:
- Data Wrangling & Cleaning using Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), and Excel
- Data Visualization (Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Predictive Analytics (Time-Series Forecasting, Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, etc.)
- Business Analysis & Decision Support

I enjoy exploring new datasets to hone my data analysis skills further, and am always open for opportunities in **data analytics and business intelligence field**, where I can apply my skills to generate real business value. 

Below are some of the projects I've done to demonstrate my skills related to data analytics.

## [Project 1: Wine Classification](./Wine%20Classification%20with%20K-Nearest%20Neighbors)
The purpose of this project was to construct a machine learning clasifier for 3 different wine types based on its constituents. The dataset used in this project was obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, which contains 13 different features and 1 target variables, with 178 data points.

Based on the analysis conducted, the classification model built using the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm was able to accurately classify 3 different wine types based on their composition, achieving an accuracy level of 97.78%.

## [Project 2: Automotive Sales Forecasting](./Automotive%20Sales%20Forecasting%20using%20Hybrid%20Model%20(Holt-Winters%20+%20Random%20Forest))
This project was part of my undergraduate thesis related to demand forecasting. In this project, a hybrid forecasting model, consisting of a time-series and a machine learning model, was constructed to forecast monthly sales of an automotive product. The dataset used to build the model consists of 7 predictor variables, and 1 target variable, which is the monthly sales of the corresponding product itself.

The result of this project was a hybrid forecast model that is able to enhance the in-sample and out-of-sample performance by 42.9% and 13.2%, respectively, compared to the standalone Holt-Winters' model, while maintaining an 83.43% higher generalization ability.

## [Project 3: E-Commerce Website Analysis](./SQL%20Project%20E-commerce%20Website%20Analysis)
This project was part of the SQL learning material I completed in a data analytics course. It contains an analysis of the database of an e-commerce website established by a fictitious company. The database consisted of six tables: website_sessions, website_pageviews, orders, order_items, order_item_refunds, and products. The analysis was conducted using PostgreSQL software.
