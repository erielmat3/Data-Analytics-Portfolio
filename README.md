## About Me
Hi! My name is Eriel, and I am an Industrial Engineering graduate with a passion in Data Analytics. I have a keen interest in turning data into meaningful insights to support decision making and drive business improvements.

As an industrial engineering graduate, I bring a strong foundation in optimization and problem-solving skills to the field of data analytics. I am able to not only analyze data, but also understand business and operational context behind it. With my experience, I believe I can translate complex data into actionable insights that can improve efficiency and support strategic decision-making.

I am skilled in:
- Data Wrangling & Cleaning using Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), and Excel
- Data Visualization (Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Predictive Analytics (Time-Series Forecasting, Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, etc.)
- Business Analysis & Decision Support

I enjoy exploring new datasets to hone my data analysis skills further, and am always open for opportunities in **data analytics and business intelligence field**, where I can apply my skills to generate real business value. 

Below are some of the projects I've done to demonstrate my skills related to data analytics.
